# Computer Use - OOTB

## üåü Overview
This is an out-of-the-box (OOTB) solution for Claude's new Computer Use APIs. 

**No Docker** is required, and it supports both **Windows** and **macOS**. This project provides a user-friendly interface based on Gradio. üé®

## Update
- 11-11: Forget about the low-resolution display limit set by Anthropic ‚Äî you can now use *any resolution you like* and still keep the **screenshot token cost low** üéâ!
- 11-11: Now both **Windows** and **macOS** platforms are supported üéâ!
- 10-25: Now you can **Remotely Control** your computer üíª through your mobile device üì± ‚Äî **No Mobile App Installation** required! Give it a try and have fun üéâ.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 0. Prerequisites
- Instal Miniconda on your system through this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download?utm_source=anacondadocs&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=download&utm_content=topnavalldocs). (**Python Version: >= 3.11**).

### 1. Clone the Repository üìÇ
Open the Conda Terminal. (After installation Of Miniconda, it will appear in the Start menu.)
Run the following command on **Conda Terminal**.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/showlab/computer_use_ootb.git
cd computer_use_ootb
```

### 2. Install Dependencies üîß
```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the Interface ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
```bash
python app.py
```
If you successfully start the interface, you will see two URLs in the terminal:
```bash
* Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
* Running on public URL: https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.gradio.live (Do not share this link with others, or they will be able to control your computer.)
```

### 4. Control Your Computer with Any Device can Access the Internet
- **Computer to be controlled**: The one installed software.
- **Device Send Command**: The one opens the website.
  
Open the website at http://localhost:7860/ (if you're controlling the computer itself) or https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.gradio.live in your mobile browser for remote control.

Enter the Anthropic API key (you can obtain it through this [website](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)), then give commands to let the AI perform your tasks.

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported Systems
- **Windows** ‚úÖ
- **macOS** ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks
- **Potential Dangerous Operations by the Model**: The models' performance is still limited and may generate unintended or potentially harmful outputs. Recommend continuously monitoring the AI's actions. 
- **Cost Control Challenges**: Each task may cost a few dollars. We'll optimize this in the future. üí∏

## üìÖ Roadmap
- [ ] **Explore available features**
  - [ ] The Claude API seems to be unstable when solving tasks. We are investigating the reasons: resolutions, types of actions required, os platforms, or planning mechanisms. Welcome any thoughts or comments on it.
- [ ] **Interface Design**
  - [x] **Support for Gradio** ‚ú®
  - [ ] **Simpler Installation**
  - [ ] **More Features**... üöÄ
- [ ] **Platform**
  - [x] **Windows** 
  - [x] **Mobile** (Send command)
  - [x] **macOS**
  - [ ] **Mobile** (Be controlled)
- [ ] **Support for More MLLMs**
  - [x] **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** üéµ
  - [ ] **GPT-4o**
  - [ ] **Qwen2-VL**
  - [ ] ...
- [ ] **Improved Prompting Strategy**
  - [ ] Optimize prompts for cost-efficiency. üí°
